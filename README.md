[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/hex-docs-ffaff3)](https://hexdocs.pm/nakai/)

Like React (sort of), mixed with Rails (sort of), but in Gleam

Very, very proof-of-concept stage right now, but you can run the example with...

## Quick start

```sh
gleam run
```

You'll also probably need to download and install [rebar3](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3)

## Installation

```sh
gleam add nakai
```
