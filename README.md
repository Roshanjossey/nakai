# Nakai

Like React (sort of), mixed with Rails (sort of), but in Gleam

Very, very proof-of-concept stage right now, but you can run the example with...

## Quick start

```sh
gleam run
```

You'll also probably need to download and install [rebar3](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3)

<!--

## Installation

If available on Hex this package can be added to your Gleam project.

```sh
gleam add nakai
```

-->
